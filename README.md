# üìà Statty ![Docker Build](https://github.com/lolPants/statty/workflows/Docker%20Build/badge.svg)

> A no-nonsense status page / statistics server.

## ‚ùî What is Statty?
Statty is an application server that powers a status page. It monitors your services and keeps track of response times and average uptime. It is designed to be lightweight and minimal, you only need to configure it once and it does the rest.

Statty can also be configured to send notifications if services are reported to be unreachable, and send all clear notifications when they come back online. Alerts are sent via Slack-compatible webhooks, and can be enabled or disabled for each service.

Statty is built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which allows the dashboard to load fast and stay responsive.

## üöÄ Running in Production
This project uses GitHub Actions to run automated docker builds, you can find them in this repo's [Package Registry](https://github.com/lolPants/statty/packages). A sample Docker Compose file has been provided for you to use as a reference.

### üìù Configuration
Statty services are configured using YAML or JSON. A [JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lolPants/statty/master/assets/config.schema.json) has been provided for use in IDEs. By default, Statty looks for `config.yaml`, `config.yml`, or `config.json` in the application's root directory. You can override this behaviour using environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for documentation.

Statty also requires a Redis database for persistence between restarts. This is configured using environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for documentation.
